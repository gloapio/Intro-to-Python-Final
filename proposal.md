# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
Snake.in
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO

A snake game where the player gets longer as they eat energy orbs and has to survice obsticles like walls and/or other snakes.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO

 This project replicates  an arcade-style 'Snake.io' game  where a player control a growing snake. The snakes eats orbs to get longer. As the player navigates in the game, they have to avoid static and moving poles which cause them to get smaller(lose orbds)as they collide with the poles. The more orbs they lose the more likely they are to fall, another way they fall is if they hit a wall. The player  aims for high scores by maximizing snake length in the space. This game will be developed in Godot, the game features responsive controls, vibrant visuals, and increasing difficulty through speed and obstacle complexity. The longer the player stays in the more challenging it becomes. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
TODO

Snake movement and eating orbs

Poles that shrink the snake

Wall collisions cause falling

A way to keep score

Increading difficulty thats manageable


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO

Static pole for increasing difficulty

Visuals and sounds to indicate good or bad standing in the game

A simple difficulty scaling system (more speed, and more orbs).

A game background that is captivating

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO

Damage to snake 

Power-ups or power-down.

A high-score system

Great visual effects and sound design.

A tutorial 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
My next steps  are understanding how the snake game works and putting my own spin on it. Also, understanding game developemtn with Godot, followed by visual asset creation and level design for static pole obstacles. I'll then focus on difficulty scaling and, if time permits, add hazard zones and power-ups. Finally, I'll polish visuals and audio, and implement a high-score system. This project will enhance my Godot 2D physics, animation, and UI skills, alongside general game development principles."
